OpenVPN embedded Python plugin.

This plugin implements V1 OpenVPN plugin interface,
thus in other words getting many info from OpenVPN
and returning only TRUE/FALSE values.

It is loaded as other plugins. Plugin parameters are:
1. module name which will be imported the same way as
if it was "import ..." from Python. Mandatory.
2. Path which will be appended to Python "sys.path"
and where also module noted in 1-st parameter will
be searched for. Not mandatory.

Module.
Module should contain anything, but at least two
callback functions must be declared:
1. plugin_up() which is called on initialization of
plugin.
2. plugin_down() which is called on OpenVPN shutdown.

Next callback which are not mandatory:
route_up()
ipchange()
tls_verify()
auth_user_pass_verify()
client_connect()
client_disconnect()
learn_address()
tls_final()
enable_pf()

During initialization of plugin those not mandatory
callback is searched for presence and if are callable.
If so, OpenVPN type mask is set for particular call-
backs, so only those, which are declared plugin
are advertised to OpenVPN.
Every callback has at least one parameter, environment
which is Python dictionary. It is not system env., but
OpenVPN environment. Callbacks are expected to return
only True/False values. Look at sample module in sources.

Import and use what you wish, but threading is not
anyhow handled. In fact may be it is not a problem
for this plugin cause of its behavior, but keep it
on mind.
